            Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium. Add 2 tablespoons butter; when melted, place both halves of two rolls cut-sides down in the skillet. Toast until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan or plate, cut-sides up. Repeat with the remaining butter and rolls.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            To the same skillet on high heat, add 1 tablespoon oil. Place two beef balls in the skillet, pressing down firmly on each with a metal spatula to flatten. (You might need to press down a few times; the goal is to make the patties very thin.) Sprinkle the top of the beef generously with salt and pepper, then scatter ¼ of the onion on each patty. Cook for 2 minutes; the undersides will be browned and crispy.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Flip the patties. Using the end of the spatula, chop each patty into small pieces and then push them into two mounds roughly the shape and size of the rolls. Drape two pieces of cheese on top of each mound. Cook until the cheese has melted, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the cheese melts, spread both ketchup and mayonnaise on the cut-sides of each roll. Use the spatula to scoop the chopped meat and cheese mixture onto the bottoms of the rolls, then top each with ¼ of the lettuce and 2 tomato slices. Sandwich with the tops of the rolls, pressing down firmly. (Transferring the chopped meat and cheese to the rolls might be a little messy. It’s OK if everything doesn’t make it onto the sandwich in one scoop.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Add remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet and repeat with remaining ingredients to make the last two sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in half and serve immediately with hot sauce, if desired.

            Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat, then add the onions and rosemary. Season with the sugar and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions get a nice dark caramel color, about 20 minutes. Fish out the rosemary.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Make the beef patties by splitting the meat in half, then patting each half between 2 pieces of wax or parchment paper until it’s thin. Each patty should be slightly bigger than the bread so when it shrinks down you’ve got meat in every bite. Season the patties with lots of salt and pepper on both sides, as if they were steaks.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Put the bread on a hot griddle, butter sides down, and divide the cheese among all 4 pieces. Put the meat on the griddle. (You can use two skillets set over high heat if you don’t have a griddle.) Smash the patties with a spatula. When they’re browned, 1 to 3 minutes, flip the patties and spread the onions over the meat. Sizzle them for a minute or 2 to brown the underside. Meanwhile, spread the Dijon-mayonnaise over the melted cheese.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Put each patty on a slice of bread and make sandwiches by topping with the other slices. Serve immediately, with pickles.

            Put chicken pieces in a bowl. Blend salt, peppers, mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika, granulated garlic and file powder. Rub four teaspoons of the mixture over the chicken. Set rest of spice mixture aside.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Put the flour in a bowl and add two teaspoons of the reserved spice mixture. Blend well.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Heat a 10-inch skillet and add the oil. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture to coat well, shaking off excess. Reserve the leftover flour.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            When the oil is hot and almost smoking, add the chicken pieces skin side down. Cook about two minutes on one side until golden brown. Turn and cook about three minutes on the second side until nicely browned. Do this in batches so as to not crowd the pan. Drain thoroughly on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Pour off all but one cup of fat from the skillet. Heat this oil over high heat until it is almost smoking and add the reserved seasoned flour. Stir rapidly and constantly with a wire whisk until the mixture is golden brown. Do not burn. This is a roux.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Add the chopped onion, celery and green pepper to the roux and stir to blend well. Remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Meanwhile, bring the broth to a boil in a large saucepan.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "8">
            Add about half a cup of the roux mixture to the broth, stirring rapidly with the whisk. Continue adding the roux mixture, half a cup at a time, always stirring rapidly and constantly.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "9">
            Add the smoked sausage and stir. Cook over high heat, stirring often from the bottom, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "10">
            Add the chicken pieces, bay leaf and finely minced fresh garlic. Cook about 40 minutes, on medium-low, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "11">
            Remove the chicken pieces. Cut the meat from the bones and discard the bones. Cut the chicken into cubes or shred it and add it back to the pot. Serve with white rice or potato salad (or both) spooned into the gumbo.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Mince anchovies and garlic and mix with a large pinch of salt until you get a rough paste. Put it in bowl and whisk in the lemon zest, juice and another pinch of salt and some pepper. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Place eggs in one shallow dish, bread crumbs in another, and flour mixed with cayenne and nutmeg in a third. Season chicken cutlets generously with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Heat ⅛ inch oil in a large skillet. While oil heats, dip cutlets one by one into flour (shake off any excess), then into eggs (ditto) and finally into the bread crumbs, taking care not to handle chicken more than necessary (hold meat by ends).
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            When oil sizzles when a pinch of bread crumbs is thrown in, add a chicken cutlet (or two if your skillet is large, leave plenty of room around them). Swirl pan so oil cascades over top of cutlet in waves. When bottom is golden brown, about 3 minutes, flip and brown the other side, swirling pan (swirling helps create air pockets, giving you lighter schnitzel). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking platter or baking tray and sprinkle with more salt. Repeat with remaining chicken.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Toss salad greens and herbs with just enough anchovy-lemon dressing to lightly coat them. Divide salad on serving plates and top with schnitzel. Drizzle with more dressing and garnish with scallions.

            Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Pat the chicken breasts dry and place them on the prepared sheet pan. Rub all over with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast until just cooked through, 35 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the breasts. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-size pieces.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            While the chicken roasts, begin making the biscuits: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Whisk until well combined. Add the butter, and working quickly, cut the butter into the flour using your fingers or a pastry cutter, until it forms crumbles about the size of peas. Switch to a fork, and stir constantly while adding the buttermilk in a slow, steady steam. Mix just until a wet, sticky dough forms. (Do not overmix!) Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, pat it into a mound, then wrap and chill it in the refrigerator while you make the filling.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion and rosemary, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds, or until no white clumps of flour are visible. Add the chicken stock, milk, 1½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat to low and simmer, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pan, until very thick, 7 to 10 minutes; remove from heat. Add the sherry, chives and chicken, and stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Unwrap the chilled biscuit dough and place it on a well-floured surface. Working quickly (you want the biscuits to be as cold as possible when they go into the oven) lightly press the dough with your hands into a rectangle about ¾-inch thick. Fold the dough in half and press once more to a ¾-inch-thick rectangle. Cut out biscuits with a 2½- to 3-inch-round cutter and arrange them on top of the filling. (You should have about 10 biscuits.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Brush the tops of the biscuits with the egg wash. Place the skillet on a sheet pan to catch any drips, and bake, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, until biscuits are puffed and golden. Cool for 10 minutes to let the filling thicken slightly, then serve.

            Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil, then add the chicken. Cook until it’s fully cooked, about 8 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board.

            Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the same skillet.

Set aside a handful of sliced scallions for serving, then add the remaining to the skillet, along with the garlic. Cook, stirring once or twice, for 1 minute. Stir in the lemon zest and remaining 1 teaspoon of Cajun-style seasoning; cook for 30 seconds.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Pour in the broth. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in cream. Bring to a low simmer and cook until the mixture just starts to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Parmesan and juice from half the lemon; stir and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and Cajun-style seasoning, if needed. Turn off the heat. Thinly slice the chicken.

            Return the drained pasta to the reserved pot and pour the sauce on top. Add chicken, tomatoes and butter. Using tongs, gently toss until butter melts and everything is coated in the silky sauce, adding reserved pasta cooking water a couple tablespoons at a time, if needed.

           Cajun-style spice blends are available at grocery stores and online. Versions vary, but most feature some combination of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, black pepper, dried thyme and dried oregano. Many mass market blends also include salt in the mix, and they work just fine in this recipe. If your spice blend comes without, make sure to increase the salt when seasoning the chicken.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            In a medium bowl, whisk 1 cup yogurt, lemon juice, 3 cloves of garlic, half the ginger and half the spice mixture together. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and chill at least 4 hours, up to 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned in spots, about 5 to 8 minutes. Add tomato paste, remaining garlic, ginger and spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently until spices are fragrant and tomato paste has started caramelizing on the bottom of the pot, about 2 minutes.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Crush tomatoes with your hands, leaving some larger bits and add them and any liquid left in the can to the pot along with the heavy cream and 1 cup water. Season with salt and pepper and stir, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until flavors meld and the sauce is thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cover until chicken is ready (or after cooling, refrigerate if marinating chicken for more than 4 hours).

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove steak from the freezer. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, then add the oil and onions. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and cook the onions, stirring every few minutes, until they begin to soften, brown, and have slightly crispy ends, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Pull the meat slices apart (they will still be slightly frozen; see Tip 1) and add them to the pan over medium-high. As the meat cooks, use a spatula to continue separating the slices so they cook evenly. When the meat is mostly cooked but still a little pink, about 4 minutes, season with salt and pepper, and cook until no longer pink and the edges are browned, about 4 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Meanwhile, slice the hoagies in half lengthwise, only about ¾ of the way through. Arrange them cut-side down on an oven rack and toast until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Once the meat is fully cooked, adjust the heat to medium-low and add the onions back to the pan, stirring until combined. Divide the filling into four piles, and top each with 3 slices of Provolone (if using Cheez Whiz, see Tip 2). Cook until the cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. While the cheese melts, remove the hoagies from the oven. Use a spatula or pastry scraper to transfer the meat onto the hoagies. Slice in half and eat immediately.

    <ul id = "recipeNotes">
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Tip 1: If using frozen, pre-sliced brisket, give it about 30 minutes to thaw before you begin cooking so the meat will be easier to separate. Otherwise, let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Tip 2: If using Cheez Whiz, transfer it to a small microwave-safe dish and heat it in the microwave in 30-second increments, or in a small skillet on the stovetop over low heat, stirring frequently, over low heat. Mix well, then pour over the sandwich.

Working with one cutlet at a time, dredge in flour with your first hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn cutlet with your second hand to coat both sides. Lift and allow excess egg to drain off, then transfer to breadcrumb mixture. With your first hand, scoop breadcrumbs on top of cutlet, then gently press, turning to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Transfer cutlet to a clean plate and repeat with remaining meat.

           Homemade dashi is nice, but not necessary for this simple dish, which has so many other strong flavors. Look for thinly shaved beef at Japanese markets, ask your butcher to shave it for you, or use frozen shaved steak intended for Philly cheesesteaks. The beef can be cooked directly from the freezer if using frozen; just add a few minutes to the cooking time, and make sure to carefully stir the beef and break it apart as it thaws. Beni-shoga is bright red pickled hot ginger. Togarashi is Japanese chile powder, which comes in both ichimi (chiles only) and shichimi (chiles blended with other dried aromatics) versions. Either will work on this dish. All of these ingredients can be found in any Japanese market or well-stocked Western supermarket.

Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1⁄4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.

            Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Cut one onion into fine dice and combine with cilantro. Refrigerate until needed. Split remaining onion into quarters. Set aside. Season pork with 1 tablespoon salt and place in a 9- by 13-inch glass baking dish. The pork should fill the dish with no extra space. Split orange into quarters and squeeze juice over pork. Nestle squeezed orange pieces into dish. Add 2 onion quarters, 4 cloves garlic, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick to dish. Nestle everything into an even layer. Pour vegetable oil over surface. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and place in oven. Cook until pork is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours.

            Start preparing the chicken: Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-low. Add the onions, cover and leave to cook, allowing the onions to start sweating, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Meanwhile, make the marinade: In a medium bowl or measuring jug, combine the stock, oil, cilantro, 1 tablespoon preserved lemon, garlic, honey, turmeric, ginger, ¾ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Pour about half of the marinade into the pan containing the onions, stirring to combine. Cover and cook over low, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the onions are cooking, add the chicken to the bowl containing the remaining marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge while the onions finish.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            When the onions are soft and translucent, add the chicken along with the marinade to the pan. Cover and simmer over medium-low for 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the chicken, stirring occasionally, until the meat is fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            When the chicken is cooked through, the sauce may have thickened slightly, but the pan should not be dry. If necessary, add 1 tablespoon stock or water at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and preserved lemon to taste.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Garnish with olives and cilantro and serve with lemon wedges and torn pieces of baguette.

            Using a dough hook on low speed, slowly drizzle water mixture into flour mixture and mix, scraping down bowl as needed, until cohesive dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next tablespoon, until all butter is fully incorporated, about 3 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead for 8 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to the bottom.

            Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand to form a smooth round ball, about 1 minute. In a lightly greased large bowl, place the dough seam side down, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a large plate, and let rise at room temperature, 68 to 74℉ (20 to 23 ℃), until the dough is doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

            Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Press down on dough to deflate and transfer the dough to a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, divide dough in 6 equal pieces (about 145g each). Shape each piece into a smooth ball and set aside on the counter.

            Working with one dough ball at a time, use your hands to flatten ball into a 5- x 4-inch rectangle. Fold the upper third of the dough toward the center. Fold the lower third of the dough to the center, mimicking an envelope fold, and lightly pinch the edges of both folded pieces together and press gently to seal the center seam where the folds meet. Then press the new seam into the bun, so it almost disappears.

            For a Charcoal Grill: Open bottom vent completely. Light chimney starter filled 3/4 of the way with charcoal briquettes (about 5 quarts). Once top coals are partially covered with ash, pour out and spread coals evenly on one side of the charcoal grate. Set grilling grate in place over coals, cover, and open lid vent.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Put the chicken breasts in a large ziplock bag with the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons salt. Remove any excess air from the bag and seal tightly. Gently massage the chicken through the bag for a minute or two. Then place the bag in a large dish or bowl and put it in the fridge to marinate overnight or for at least 10 hours. If you&#39;d like, you can rotate the bag once or twice while marinating to ensure adequate coverage of the chicken.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Approximately 30-45 minutes before you plan to roast the chicken, remove the bag from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature to take the chill off the meat. Keep the bag sealed with the chicken still in the marinade.

            Meanwhile, put the pistachios meats, garlic, lemon zest (reserve the lemon halves or wedges), olive oil, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a mini food processor or blender.

            Once the chicken breasts and marinade have rested at room temperature for 30-45 minutes, discard the marinade and pat the chicken breasts dry with a few sheets of paper towel. Arrange the chicken breasts close together (but not overlapping) in a thick-sided, oven-proof skillet or high-sided baking dish. Smear generous amounts of the pistachio pesto underneath the skin of each breast and on the bottom where meat is exposed. Use any excess pesto to coat the top of the skins. Arrange the lemon halves or wedges around the chicken breasts. Position the skillet or baking dish in the center (middle rack) of a pre-heated 375° for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, rotate the pan a half-turn and continue baking for another 20-25 minutes or until the juices of the chicken run clear. Remove the skillet or baking dish from the oven, fully tent it with aluminum foil, and let the chicken rest and re-absorb some of its juices for 8-10 minutes.

            Put the chicken into a large bowl. Roughly chop the fresh herbs and garlic and throw into the bowl. Cut the lemon into slices and squeeze over the chicken and then throw the slices into the bowl as well, adding the olive oil, salt and pepper and mixing together. Let marinate for a few hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            On medium to high heat up an oven safe pan on the stove and add 2-3 tbsp of butter. Once melted and sizzling place the chicken into the pan, cook until golden on each side, maybe even a little crispy (about 3-4 minutes per side). Once both sides have a nice colour to them place the pan in the oven to finish the cooking around 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the chicken is in the oven you can make the tzatziki.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Mince the garlic and add to a small bowl with the yogurt, sour cream, salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Deseed the cucumber (cutting out the soft middle part) and finely chop into tiny pieces, I keep my skin on but you can cut it off if you like that better. Add the cucumber to the yogurt mixture and combine. Top with the olive oil adding more depending on the thickness you would like the tzatziki.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Warm your pita up in the oven and then top with sliced chicken, tzatziki and any other desired toppings (suggestions above).

            Marinate the chicken: Clean and trim off any excess fat from the chicken thighs. Add them to a medium bowl, followed by the peri peri sauce, kosher salt, ground black pepper, ground turmeric, ground cayenne, ground cumin, garlic powder, smoked paprika and dried oregano flakes.

            Cook the chicken: Spray a deep medium nonstick skillet (26cm/10.5-inch) with cooking oil spray and heat over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6-8 minutes, turning every 2 minutes, until cooked through and slightly charred. Use a digital kitchen thermometer to pierce the thickest part and ensure that the internal temperature has reached 75°C/160°F. Transfer to a clean plate and set aside. Scrape off and discard and burnt marinade bits from the pan and return to the stovetop.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Sauté the veggies and aromatics: Spray the skillet with cooking oil spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add the red onion, red bell pepper, garlic and red chilies. Sauté for 30-40 seconds until the red onion and bell pepper start to soften and the garlic and chilies are fragrant.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Add the tomato paste, seasonings and rice: Add the double concentrated tomato paste, kosher salt, ground black pepper, ground cayenne, ground cumin, smoked paprika, ground coriander, crushed red pepper flakes dried oregano flakes and the brown rice.

            Stir in water and simmer: Pour in the water and stir to combine. Once it comes to a boil, immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer for 7 minutes, then uncover and stir in the green peas. Cover and simmer for 28-30 minutes until the rice is tender and there is no excess liquid in the pan. Switch off the heat allow to rest for 5 minutes with the lid still on.

            Turn the Instant Pot on the sauté mode and heat neutral oil. Once hot, add the cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, and mustard seeds. Once the cumin and mustard seeds begin popping, add the diced onion and whole chili peppers and fry until the onions turn light brown. Mix the turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala, chili powder, chana masala, salt to taste, ginger, and garlic well into the mixture. Add the tomato paste in last and simmer until the oil separates on the sides and the mixture has darkened in color.

            Slowly add the 2 tablespoon of water into the mixture until a gravy forms. Continue to mix the gravy until the oil starts to separate on the sides.

            Wash the chickpeas a few times and drain it. Pour the chickpeas into the gravy and toss it until the chickpeas are well coated. Pour in the 3 cups of water.

            Uncover the Instant Pot. With a potato masher, mash the chickpeas 5-6 times to thicken up the gravy. Allow the chickpeas to rest with the lid slightly uncovered for 5-10 minutes.

      Steps

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            1. Grind up some ginger, garlic, rock salt &amp; chilli.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            2. Roast some cumin and coriander seeds in a dry pan until they smoke – this will give the spices a far richer flavour
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            3. Grind the whole lot together into a paste
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            4. Some people like to slash their chicken, but I prefer to prick it all over with a fork – this helps the marinade to really get deep inside the chicken
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            5. Squeeze some lemon juice to start the marinading process – this tenderises the chicken and makes it much easier for the marinade to permeate the meat
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            6. Add in the paste made earlier and some coriander powder and paprika
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            7. Add in a couple of tablespoons of fresh yoghurt and mix the whole lot together. Leave to marinade for at least 6 hours (I made this batch before going to work – means it’s ready for dinner)
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            8. Some recipes call for the marinade to have some red food colouring. DON’T! Chuck it away!
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            9. Time to cook our chicken. If, like me, you don’t have a tandoor oven, then BBQ is your next best option.
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            10. While chicken is cooking, drink beer. Some people feel this is optional, it is not.
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            11. Mmmmm, Chicken! If you stopped here, you’ve got a great starter dish – really tender and full of flavour. But, to make Murgh Makhani, you need to make a sauce to put the chicken in.
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            For the sauce:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            12. Fry onions, garlic, cardamon, garam masala and chilli powder in the butter

        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            Add in the tomatoes and a little water
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            Reduce the mixture down and leave to cool a little.
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            13. Pour the mixture into a blender and blend to a smooth paste. You can sieve the mixture, if you wish, but I prefer the thickness of the mix.
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            14. Pour back in to the pan on a medium heat and add in the cream
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            15. Add the chicken and warm through. 16. Top with some garnish like coriander leaves or spring onions.

Add half of short ribs and brown well on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in 3 batches, depending on size of Dutch oven—do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet or plate. Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them in the fat remaining in Dutch oven. Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer all rendered fat into a small bowl and reserve separately. Allow short ribs to cool at room temperature.

            Meanwhile, return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and add 1 cup (240ml) chicken broth, using a flat wooden spoon or stiff spatula to scrape browned bits off of bottom of pan. Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer, add toasted chiles to liquid, and cook until chiles have softened and liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to a blender. Add ground spices, chocolate, tomato paste, coffee, anchovies, soy sauce, and Marmite.

Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic, fresh chiles, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chile purée and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot, until chile mixture begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Add remaining chicken stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting, add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender, about 1 hour. Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is okay).

            Using a sharp knife, carefully fillet each chicken breast into two thinner cutlets (or use thin-cut chicken breasts).
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Season each breast with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Then sprinkle the flour over both sides of the chicken breasts and rub it in until the chicken is evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and 1 Tbsp of butter. Once the skillet is hot, add the chicken and cook on each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 4 minutes per side). Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the chicken is cooking, peel the garlic cloves and then carefully smash them with the side of a large chef&#39;s knife by pressing down on the side of the knife with the heel of your hand.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Once the chicken is removed, to the same skillet add the remaining 1 Tbsp of butter, then add the garlic cloves. Turn the heat down to medium-low and sauté the garlic for 3 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Make sure to stir the garlic frequently to prevent it from burning.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Next pour the chicken broth and heavy cream into the skillet, then add the garlic powder. Stir and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer in the skillet for 8-10 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened by about 50%. Taste the sauce at this point and add salt and pepper if needed (I added about ⅛ tsp of salt and ⅛ tsp of black pepper).
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Finally, return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet and spoon the creamy sauce over top. Allow the chicken to heat through. Serve with fresh chopped parsley (optional), and enjoy!

        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Once the rice is ready, mix in the cilantro and 2 tablespoon of lime juice (per batch). Taste and add more lime juice and/or salt if desired. Set aside, covered, until ready to use.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Begin with 12 oz of cooked, prepared chicken from the Marinated Chicken for Tacos recipe. I make this chicken in bulk, freeze the cooked chicken in 12 oz portions, and defrost to use in this recipe for a quick meal.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            Warm the defrosted chicken in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, as you prepare the rest of the meal (skip if chicken has been freshly prepared and is still warm). Add a splash of chicken stock or water to the meat if it seems a bit dry. You can also warm the chicken in the microwave if desired.
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Assemble the burritos: Use about ½ cup of cilantro lime rice, and form it into a flat rectangle. Top the rice with the chicken, then onion, then cheese. Roll up the burrito as securely as possible. (If you&#39;re using pre-cooked tortillas, warm them up in a skillet or the microwave before rolling the burrito to make them more flexible)

            Place the burritos seem-side-down in a preheated sandwich press and cook, until slightly golden on the outside, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, use a skillet set over medium heat, turning as needed. Serve immediately, with your favorite salsa for dipping (I use avocado salsa).

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Uncooked tortillas are one of my favorite new products. They come in the refrigerated section at the grocery store, and can be prepared in just a few minutes. They make super high quality fresh tortillas that take these burritos to the next level!
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           If you want to make this easier, just pick up a standard 8 oz bag of microwave cilantro lime rice! After microwaving, divide the rice into 4 portions for the burritos, it will be a little less than ½ cup per burrito.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Add water, bring the mixture together and knead until the pastry becomes elastic. This will take longer than normal pastry but it gives the pastry the strength that is needed to hold the filling and retain a good shape. This can also be done in a food mixer.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Cover with cling film and leave to rest for 3 hours in the fridge. This is a very important stage as it is almost impossible to roll and shape the pastry when fresh.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Roll out the pastry and cut into circles approx. 20cm diameter. A side plate is an ideal size to use as a guide.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Layer the vegetables and meat on top of the pastry, adding plenty of seasoning as you go. The amount of salt and pepper to use will vary according to taste but a good rule of thumb is to use a good pinch of salt and a gentle pinch of pepper on each layer.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Bring the pastry around and crimp the edges together (see our guide to crimping).

           Top tips:
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Beef skirt is the cut traditionally used for Cornish pasties. This is the underside of the belly of the animal. It has no gristle and little fat, cooks in the same amount of time as the raw vegetables and its juice produces wonderful gravy.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Use a firm waxy potato such as Maris Peer or Wilja. A floury potato will disintegrate on cooking.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Cornish pasties freeze well. It’s best to freeze them after glazing but before baking. They can be baked from frozen, just reduce the oven temperature a little and add an extra few minutes to the baking time.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Be sure to check that your pasties are piping hot all the way through before eating, whether you’re baking them from scratch, from frozen or reheating them.

            Heat the Mazola® Corn Oil in a medium-size saucepan at medium-high heat.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Once the oil is hot, add the diced carrots and sauté for about 5 minutes. After this time, they should look semi-cooked and have a bright orange color.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            While the carrots are cooking, place the chopped tomatoes, onion, garlic, and 2 cups of water into a blender. Process it to make a smooth sauce. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Now that your carrots have been cooking for 5 minutes, stir in the shell pasta (conchas) and stir fry for about 3 minutes. Stir constantly until you obtain a light golden color on the pasta. It’s ok if the pasta has some golden-brown spots. These brown spots add more flavor!
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Pour the tomato sauce, plus 2 additional cups of water, into the saucepan. Stir in the chicken bouillon, and check to verify if it doesn’t need more salt (according to your taste). Bring the soup to a quick boil by turning the heat to high.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Once the soup starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Cook for 10 minutes over low heat. After this time, add the spinach and stir, then cook for 5 more minutes. Afterward, remove the saucepan from the heat, since you don’t want the spinach to be overcooked. Serve in small bowls and enjoy your Mexican Pasta Soup with Spinach &amp; Carrots!

        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Place the peppers in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer over medium heat until they look soft. Let them cool and drain.

            Season the meat with salt and pepper. Place the sauce and steaks in a large bowl, marinate the meat.

        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Now, this is the easiest since almost anyone has a frying pan or skillet at home. Once your meat has marinated, cut it into small fine strips. Make sure to remove any excess adobo sauce.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "8">
            Warm the frying pan and add 1 – 2 Tablespoons of oil until hot enough that it sizzles when you place the meat. Add onion and pineapple slices along with the meat to cook.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "9">
            Make sure to turn the meat as needed to avoid the meat sticking to the pan.

            Cooking in a Vertical Rotisserie:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            To cook in the &nbsp;Vertical Rotisserie, stack the meat intercalated with slices of onions and pineapple. Let any marinade drain for 20 minutes before starting the timer. 1 Hr. is enough to cook 2 pounds. Cooking will vary depending on your Rotiserrie equipment,
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            After the meat is cooked, shave or slice it with a sharp knife and place it in an already-warm skillet to give it that crisper taste as they do at the taquerias in Mexico.

            This option to make your tacos al pastor at home is using the broiler in your oven. Cut the meat as for Kabobs and insert into the skewer placing onion and pineapple slices between the meat.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            This method will take about 20 minutes to cook, rotating at least twice while cooking.

           I just mentioned how marinating the meat produces juicy and tender meat. However, don&#39;t marinate for more than 24 hours. The acidity of the mixture can break down the meat too much.

            First, I recommend peeling the potatoes and boiling them until well cooked. While the potatoes are cooking, you can start your prep work to have everything in hand when the tacos are ready.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Start by cutting the cilantro, lettuce and have everything set to build your taco. I recommend picking the red onions one night before so they can be ready the next day. I will provide that recipe with this delicious taco recipe. There are many ways to compliment your tacos, for example, you can cook some red rice or refried beans. Many people like to add avocado on top with plenty of homemade salsa.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Cook the chorizo with a spoonful of olive oil, when ready add the potatoes and mash them together. You are going to make a chorizo mash, adding a pinch of salt, garlic powder, and oregano. It is very important to season your taco filling for a bold flavor, many people won’t season it thinking the chorizo will give the entire flavor. You will notice the difference when seasoned with the oregano. It provides aroma, besides just being salty with just plain salt.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Fill your tortillas and close them with a toothpick, so your filling won’t come out while frying or your taco may open.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            When set fry the oil in a pan large enough to fit at least 4 of the tacos. It is better to cook little by little than a much bigger batch so your tacos will fry well. Let the oil be very hot, when you put your taco in because if it is not hot enough your tacos won’t come out, as they should. Their consistency will be chewy and we want them “bien dorados”. Let them sit for a minute for the excess oil to dry. After that, you can enjoy your tacos with everything on top. Enjoy!

           Use vegetable broth for a vegetarian version. Replace with beef broth for a more robust flavor.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Use dried mint or parsley if fresh herbs aren’t available.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Some cooks in Mexico use granulated chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth. Follow the package directions to make the 4 cups of broth needed. &nbsp;You can also add extra broth for a more liquid soup.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           You can add other diced vegetables like carrots, potatoes, zucchini, chayote, cabbage, and potatoes to the broth while it is simmering. If adding carrots, add them at the beginning with the tomato sauce. Other vegetables will take less time to cook and can be added when you add the meatballs.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           I prefer to buy ground meat with a little bit of fat, like the one sold at the market with an 85/15% fat content. It has more flavor, and you can easily remove the fat after it floats to the surface of the broth.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           If you want to make your Mexican Meatballs spicy, add serrano or jalapeño peppers to the tomato salsa while you are making it in the blender.

            Fry the tortilla and bread until crisp. Only add a little more lard at a time or it will be absorbed, specially by the tortilla and bread.

            Add plantain and sauté until golden, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, drain excess fat and transfer to bowl. Make sure to use a ripe plantain.

            This is the bowl where all the fried and toasted ingredients were placed and now are ready to go into the blender. It is going to look a little bit messy. Crush the bread and tortilla roughly, chop the tomatoes roasted tomatoes. This will make the grinding process a little bit easier.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "13">
            Put ½ cup of the chicken broth into the blender jar, don’t forget to add peeled garlic. Gradually add the spice mixture and blend well; then add another ½ cup of broth and gradually blend the fried ingredients to a slightly fine paste. Try not to add more liquid (unless your blender motor is heating or smoking) but constantly release the blades with a rubber spatula. You will have to do this step in 2 or 3 batches until everything has been pureed. I use my Vitamix and grind the whole sauce twice. If the end results are still coarse, pass the whole mixture through a strainer.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "14">
            In a large skillet over medium heat, reheat the sauce, scraping the bottom of the pan very often to avoid sticking. Season with salt.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "15">
            Continue frying until the mixture is very thick, about 8 minutes, and stir. Add more broth as needed to desire thickness and continue cooking, the mixture should be bubbling and splattering—for about 25 minutes. By now pools of oil should be forming on the surface.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "16">
            Add cooked chicken to hot mole; simmer until chicken is heated through, about 10 minutes. To serve, place a piece of chicken on a warm plate. Spoon on plenty of the mole sauce; sprinkle with sesame seeds. In Mexico it is usually serve with white rice with peas and a lot of warm tortillas.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_next">
            This mole can be made well ahead and the leftover sauce can be kept very successfully in the freezer for about six months. When reheated it will probably have to be diluted with more broth and freshly cooked chicken, or better yet used for chicken-filled enchiladas.

            Meanwhile, add the oats and 2 cups of milk to a blender, and blend until smooth. The oats need to have a fine texture after this step.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Blending the oats before cooking helps create a smooth, uniform texture, but if you prefer a rustic or chunkier texture, you can skip the blending and cook the oats whole. For this step, you can use your blender or small food processor.

           For a dairy-free version, use plant-based milk like almond, oat, coconut, or soy milk instead of cow’s milk. Coconut and almond milk will add a subtle sweetness, so adjust the sugar in the recipe.

            Cut the corn tortillas into small squares, about 1½ in. wide. You can use a knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut them.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Once it is hot, place the tortilla pieces in the oil and fry them until they are golden brown. Make sure to use a frying pan that is large enough, in order to not overcrowd the pan. Stir and turn the tortilla pieces as needed until they acquire a golden-brown color. This step will take about 6 minutes.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Return the frying pan to the stove and place it over medium heat. Add the chopped white onion and lightly fry it for a few seconds, then stir in the chopped serrano pepper. Keep cooking for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Add the chopped tomato and cook for about 3 more minutes, then add the eggs. Let the eggs start to cook without stirring them yet.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Once the egg whites start to look cooked around the edges, gently stir the eggs. Once you see the egg yolks start to cook, stir in the tortilla chips, season with salt, and gently mix them together with the eggs. When the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove the frying pan from the heat. The tortillas should still be crispy by the time you serve your migas. Do not wait until the eggs are cooked to add the tortilla chips. Remember that the eggs will keep cooking even after you remove the frying pan from the heat.

            Migas, as many Mexican Breakfasts, are traditionally served with refried beans or plain cooked beans topped with some crumbled Queso Fresco, and some avocado slices on the side. Some people also place a spicy salsa on the table for those that want to add more heat to their Migas.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           For this recipe, you can leave the already cut-out tortilla pieces on a baking sheet covered with a kitchen napkin on your counter. That way the tortillas will be dry and will absorb less oil at cooking time. &nbsp;They will also take less time to get crispy.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           You can use another type of tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           If you have any leftover Migas, store them in the fridge for up to two days inside an airtight container. Reheat in a frying pan at medium heat for about 6-8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           The only downside for leftover Migas is that the tortillas will become soft.

            For the filling:

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Place the clean peppers in a medium size saucepan along with 3 cups of water. Turn the heat to medium high. Once the water comes to a boil, turn the heat off and let the peppers soak in that water for 15 minutes. This will allow the peppers to soften. In case they still don’t look soft after the 15 minutes, leave them in for another 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            While the peppers are soaking, season the ground beef with salt and pepper and mix well. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet at medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meat and fry it at medium heat. Cook the meat for about 5 minutes, then stir in the chopped onion and minced garlic. Keep cooking for 1 more minute.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Add the diced carrots to the skillet and cook for 4 minutes. After that time, stir in the potatoes and keep cooking for about 8 more minutes
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            At this time, remove the peppers from the soaking water and place them in your blender with ½ cup of the soaking water or clean water. Process the peppers and water until you have a smooth sauce.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Using a strainer, pour the sauce into the skillet. The strainer will catch the leftover bits and pieces from the pepper skins. Stir and check the sauce for seasoning, and add salt if needed. Keep cooking for about 5 more minutes, until the vegetables are cooked. Make sure you do not overcook the vegetables, since they will keep cooking when you steam the tamales. Make sure that the potatoes still have some shape to them, otherwise they will disintegrate when you cook the tamales.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            For the cornhusks:

        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Take the husks out from their package, separate them, and remove any corn silk that they might have on them. Inspect the husks and discard any that are damaged or have holes in them.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Place the husks in a warm bath of hot or warm water to soak for 30 minutes. You can do this in a large pot, a large bowl, or in your kitchen sink. This step will help to soften the husks so that they are pliable when you’re assembling the tamales.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            For the dough:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">

            Slowly add the corn masa harina, and then add the chicken broth. Mix well, taste, and season with salt. Beat until all the ingredients are well combined and the dough is light and spongy.

            Assembling the tamales:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Remove the husks from their warm water, then shake them dry or dry them with a kitchen towel. You want to remove any excess water they might have.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Place one cornhusk on your work surface, with the wide end facing towards you. Spread about 2-3 tablespoons of dough in the center, but closer to the bottom of the cornhusk. Use a spoon or plastic spatula to spread the dough out evenly.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Top with 2 tablespoons of the ground beef filling in the center of the dough. Fold one side of the husk towards the center, then fold the other side towards the center, too. Finally, fold the narrow end towards the center. Repeat this process with remaining husks, dough, and filling.

            Cooking the tamales:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Place the tamales on a tray while you’re finishing up with the rest of the assembly process.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            To get your pot ready for steaming, add 3 cups of hot water into the pot and place the steamer rack inside.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Place a layer of cornhusks on the steamer rack, then place the tamales on top of that in a standing position. Next, cover the tamales with another layer of the cornhusks and a dish towel. Finally, place the lid on the pot.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Steam the tamales over medium heat for about 60 minutes, or until the corn husk easily separates from the dough (you’ll have to pull a tamale out of the pot to test this). During the steaming time, check the steamer to see if it needs more water (be careful when removing the lid). When the tamales are done, wait for 10 minutes so that the dough can firm up. Serve the tamales while still hot.

            Heat a griddle and roast the tomatoes, garlic cloves and onion. Roast until tomatoes are blistered and slightly softened. Rotate often for an even roasting. Garlic cloves will roast faster. Remove them after a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Once the vegetables are roasted, peel the tomatoes place them into a blender with the onion and garlic, puree until you have a smooth sauce. Add some chicken broth if needed.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            In a large pot, heat the 1 Tbsp. of vegetable oil over medium high heat. Add the tomato sauce mix and cook for about 3 minutes, it will start boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. The color of the sauce will reduce and change color.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the sauce is cooking, start cutting the tortillas into thin strips in case you haven’t already done that.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            After the 5 minutes of simmering the sauce, add the chicken broth and turn the heat up. When it starts to boil, lower the heat to simmer for about 10-12 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Add the Epazote branch and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 3 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Now, in a large skillet heat the oil and start frying the tortillas (making sure not to over crowd the skillet) until they are crispy and have a golden color. You will need to work in batches in this step. Place the fried tortillas over a plate covered with paper napkins to drain any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "8">
            In the remaining oil, fry the pasilla pepper strips, these will get crisp very quickly. Once they get crispy, remove and set aside.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "9">
            Gather all your garnishes: cut the lime in wedges and the avocado in cubes, ready to assemble the bowls of soup.

        <li class = "instruction" value = "10">
            Ladle the soup into bowls add the tortilla strips and then the rest of the garnishes. You can also place the garnishes at the table and let everyone serve themselves.

           *You can also add one pasilla pepper to the sauce, soak one pepper in water and onece soften add to the tomatoes while making the sauce.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           The pasilla peppers have shiny dark brown and wrinkled skin. The color resembles that of a prune’s skin. It is a very mild pepper used to make the famous Salsa Borracha (Drunken Sauce), as a garnish for the tortilla soup, and in moles and stews. Some recipes also include the seeds and the veins in order to give more flavor and spiciness to the dish.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           ** Day old tortillas are better for frying since they are dryer and absorb less oil and tend to crisp faster. Just leave them on your kitchen counter overnight, cover with a kitchen napkin or place in your oven at 250 for 10-12 minutes before frying. Or you could bake the tortilla strips instead of frying.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           *** Some cooks prefer not to roast the tomato, onion, and garlic. These ingredients are just chopped and puree in the blender and skipping the roasting step. That is a personal choice.

    <ol id = "recipeInstructions">
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Prepare the chicken: In a small bowl, stir together the onion powder, garlic powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 ½ teaspoons pepper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Set each chicken breast on a cutting board. Set one palm on top of one breast to hold it still then use a chef’s knife with the other hand to slice the breast in half horizontally. Repeat with the second chicken breast, then, using a meat mallet or the bottom of a heavy skillet, pound each piece until no more than ⅓-inch thick. Season generously on both sides with half the seasoned salt.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Set the flour and eggs into two separate shallow bowls. To a third, add the panko, finely grated Parmesan and the remaining seasoned salt and stir to combine. Dip one piece of chicken into the flour to coat all over, then transfer to the eggs and turn to coat. Add to the panko mixture and turn, pressing panko into it until fully coated. Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining chicken. (The breaded chicken will hold in the refrigerator for a few hours.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            In a medium nonstick skillet, heat a ½-inch layer of oil over medium-high. Working in two batches, add the breaded chicken and cook, undisturbed, until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. (You could also cook them all at once in a large skillet, though you’ll need twice the amount of oil to do so.) Transfer to a wire rack and lightly sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            While the chicken cooks, prepare the salad: In a large bowl, whisk to combine the olive oil and lemon juice; season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the arugula, cherry tomatoes (if using) and shaved Parmesan; toss to coat then season to taste again with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Divide the chicken among plates and pile the salad on the side. Serve immediately, with lemon wedges for squeezing on top.

      Steps
    </div>
    <ol id = "recipeInstructions">
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Before you start cooking, soak the bamboo skewers in water to cover for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Marinate the chicken: Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and peppercorns to a fine powder. Transfer to a large bowl (if using a large enough mortar, you can use that), add the tamarind paste, brown sugar, turmeric, salt, cinnamon and ½ cup coconut milk. Whisk to thoroughly combine.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Slice the chicken against the grain on the diagonal into ½-inch-thick strips. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, mix well to coat and marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes, or cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. (The longer the chicken marinates, the better. As the chicken marinates, turn it in the marinade a couple of times.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            While the chicken marinates, prepare the peanut sauce: Place the peanuts in the bowl of a food processor, or use a mortar and pestle, and grind the peanuts until finely ground but with texture. (Take care not to grind into peanut butter!) Set aside.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "5">
            Add ⅓ cup of the coconut milk to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the red curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and the oil separates, about 5 minutes. (Depending on the fat content of the coconut milk, the oil might not separate and that’s OK.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "6">
            Add the remaining coconut milk, the peanuts, tamarind paste and palm sugar. Adjust heat to medium-low and gently simmer, stirring frequently and making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom or slides of the pot, until thickened to the consistency of a dip, about 5 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick before 5 minutes, add a splash of water so the flavors have time to fully develop. Taste and add more fish sauce, if desired, and more tamarind paste to brighten. Transfer to a serving bowl and set aside. (The peanut sauce can be covered and refrigerated up to 1 week in advance or stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "7">
            Prepare the ajaad (if desired): In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar and a small pinch of salt. Cook over medium, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Place the cucumber and chiles (if using) in a small serving bowl and pour in the cooled pickling liquid. Cover until ready to serve. (The vinegar mixture and cucumber should not be combined more than 30 minutes in advance, so the cucumber stays fresh and crisp.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "8">
            Cook the chicken: Thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers. If grilling, heat a grill on high (skip to the next step if cooking on the stovetop). Shake off any excess marinade and place the chicken skewers perpendicular to the grates, for grill marks. Discard the marinade. Cook, uncovered, until browned and slightly charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and grill the other side until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "9">
            If cooking on the stovetop, heat a large pan (preferably non-stick or cast-iron) or grill pan over medium-high. Add enough oil to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, after about 90 seconds, cook until browned on each side and cooked though, 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Do not crowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.)
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "10">
            Serve chicken skewers with ajaad, and peanut sauce for dipping.

    </div> 
    <ul id = "recipeNotes">
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           For the best results, use coconut milk with the highest fat content (ideally 15 grams per can). One 14-ounce can of coconut milk will be enough for the chicken marinade and the peanut sauce.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Thai tamarind paste is not the same as Indian or Mexican tamarind pastes. Use Thai tamarind paste (sometimes labeled concentrate), available at Asian markets and online, for this recipe.

            For the chicken: Combine the lemon juice, oregano, coriander, garlic, and olive oil in a blender. Blend until smooth. Season the marinade to taste with kosher salt and black pepper. Place the chicken in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and add half of the marinade (reserve the remaining marinade in the refrigerator). Turn the chicken to coat, seal the bag, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, turning occasionally to redistribute the marinade (see Note).

Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat until it is lightly smoking. Add the chicken pieces and cook without disturbing until they are lightly browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the center of each thigh registers 165°F. on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes longer.

        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            FOR THE SALSA:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Place the cleaned peppers and tomatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Cook for about 15 minutes over medium heat until they’re soft.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Place the contents of the saucepan in your blender and process until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            FOR THE DOUGH:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Detach the husk from the cobs and place in a large pot with hot water to soften (see notes).
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Remove the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife, then place them in your blender or food processor. Process until they’ve been around, but still have some texture. Pour in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Stir in the softened lard (or butter) and mix well. Add the masa-harina little by little as needed. Depending on how watery your dough is, you will need to add or reduce the amount of masa-harina. Mix the dough until it looks like a smooth and thick cake batter.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "4">
            Season with salt and sugar. The amount of sugar and salt will depend on the corn flavor, and your taste. Sometimes, the corn is too sweet and other times they are just plain in taste. Remember that some of this seasoning gets lost when you are steaming the tamales.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            ASSEMBLING THE TAMALES:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Remove the husks from their warm bath and drain well. Place the smallest husks at the bottom of your steamer.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "2">
            Place two husks together, with the wide sides facing each other and slightly overlapping (if the husks are too small, you can place more than two together). Spread ⅓ cup of the corn masa dough and add 3 – 4 small cubes of the raw pork meat, then top with 3 tablespoons of the sauce. Finally, place an epazote leaf (if using) on top of the salsa.
        </li>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "3">
            Fold the sides of the husk to the center and then do the same with the narrow edges of the husks. To tie the tamales, do so in the same way as if you were tying a package.
        </li>
        <div class = "instruction instruction_subheader">
            TO COOK THE TAMALES:
        </div>
        <li class = "instruction" value = "1">
            Place the steaming rack in your pot, add 2 cups of hot water, and cover the steaming rack with the small husks. Place the tamales in the pot, arranging them in a vertical position. You can also place them in a horizontal position like I did in the pictures (my pot is too small to hold them vertically). Cover the tamales with extra corn husks and then place the lid on the pot. Cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Check the pot during the cooking time to see if you need to add more hot water.

        <li class = "recipeNote">
           One chipotle pepper won’t render a spicy sauce. If you like spicy, you can add two or more peppers.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           Not everyone can find lard in their area, but butter works very well for these types of tamales.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           You can also use dried husks (the ones sold in packages) for this recipe, or a combination of both

Some people like adding spices like cayenne pepper or chili powder.

           Familia Kitchen doesn’t usually list specific brands in our recipes, but Patricia and her mother’s mole specifically calls for the following three products, available at most grocery stores: Doña Maria Mole sauce, Abuelita chocolate tablets (which have a subtle, almost-bitter, deep flavor—different from U.S. chocolate), and Cacique Crema Mexicana.
        </li>
        <li class = "recipeNote">
           You can use white sugar in the mole sauce, but Patricia’s mother recommends using café azucar or brown sugar because it is sweeter and richer.
