Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.",
    "notes": "If you do not have an oven-proof skillet, you can transfer beef mixture to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish for assembly and baking. Cottage pie can be fully assembled and refrigerated (up to 2 days) or frozen (up to 3 months) in advance, then baked. If frozen, allow to defrost fully before baking."

    "directions": "1. Make the recipe with us Watch:\n2. If using chicken breasts, start from the thickest end and slice each chicken breast in half horizontally so you end up with a total of 6 cutlets (see Tip). Season both sides of the chicken cutlets well with salt and pepper.\n3. Scatter the flour on a large plate and coat the cutlets, shaking off the excess. Transfer the cutlets to a sheet pan or large plate in a single layer.\n4. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter. As soon as it melts, add the cutlets and cook until golden on one side, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook the other side until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Do this in batches, if needed, adding more oil, if needed. Transfer the cutlets to a plate or sheet pan.\n5. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stirring until the color deepens, about 2 minutes. Add the oregano and red-pepper flakes, to taste.\n6. Increase the heat to medium, add the stock and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.\n7. Add ½ cup of the cream and warm through, stirring, until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Watch the cream closely, reducing the heat if necessary, to maintain a gentle simmer. Stir in the Parmesan and the sun-dried tomatoes. Add more cream, if you like, and season the sauce.\n8. Place the chicken back in the pan to warm through, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and scatter basil on top.",

Rub all over with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast until just cooked through, 35 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the breasts. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then discard the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-size pieces.\n3. While the chicken roasts, begin making the biscuits: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Whisk until well combined. Add the butter, and working quickly, cut the butter into the flour using your fingers or a pastry cutter, until it forms crumbles about the size of peas. Switch to a fork, and stir constantly while adding the buttermilk in a slow, steady steam. Mix just until a wet, sticky dough forms. (Do not overmix!) Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, pat it into a mound, then wrap and chill it in the refrigerator while you make the filling.\n4. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion and rosemary, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.\n5. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds, or until no white clumps of flour are visible. Add the chicken stock, milk, 1½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat to low and simmer, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pan, until very thick, 7 to 10 minutes; remove from heat. Add the sherry, chives and chicken, and stir until well combined.\n6. Unwrap the chilled biscuit dough and place it on a well-floured surface. Working quickly (you want the biscuits to be as cold as possible when they go into the oven) lightly press the dough with your hands into a rectangle about ¾-inch thick. Fold the dough in half and press once more to a ¾-inch-thick rectangle. Cut out biscuits with a 2½- to 3-inch-round cutter and arrange them on top of the filling. (You should have about 10 biscuits.)\n7. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the egg wash. Place the skillet on a sheet pan to catch any drips, and bake, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes, until biscuits are puffed and golden. Cool for 10 minutes to let the filling thicken slightly, then serve.",
    "notes": "The biscuit dough may be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. If you plan to make the biscuit dough more than an hour in advance, follow the directions for kneading the dough and cutting out the biscuits before chilling them."

    "ingredients": "4 boneless pork sirloin cutlets, 4 to 5 ounces ( 110 to 140 g) each\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n8 (1-inch-thick) slices day-old Japanese milk bread (see notes) or 1 1/2 cups dried Japanese-style panko breadcrumbs (about 5 ounces; 140g)\n1 cup all-purpose flour (about 5 ounces; 140 g)\n3 large eggs, thoroughly beaten\nVegetable, canola, or peanut oil, for frying\n## To Serve:\nTo Serve:\nFinely shredded green cabbage\nLemon wedges\nCooked short-grain white rice\nJapanese-style pickles (sunomono), optional\nHomemade or store-bought tonkatsu sauce",
    "directions": "1. Place cutlets, one at a time, in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag and pound gently to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat pounder or the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet. Season generously with salt and pepper.\n2. Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez:\n3. If using slices of fresh Japanese milk bread: Using a sharp or serrated knife, trim crust from milk bread; discard trimmings. Cut trimmed bread lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch-thick batons. Using a food processor fitted with the grater attachment, process bread into coarse flakes.\n4. Serious Eats / Two Bites:\n5. Fill 3 wide, shallow bowls or high-rimmed plates with flour, beaten eggs, and panko, respectively. Working with one cutlet at a time, dredge in flour with your first hand, shaking off excess. Transfer to egg dish, then turn cutlet with your second hand to coat both sides. Lift and allow excess egg to drain off, then transfer to breadcrumb mixture. With your first hand, scoop breadcrumbs on top of cutlet, then gently press, turning to ensure a good layer of crumbs on both sides. Transfer cutlet to a clean plate and repeat with remaining meat. If this is done properly, your first hand should touch only dry ingredients, while your second hand should touch only wet, making the process less messy.\n6. Serious Eats / Fred Hardy:\n7. Fill a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet with 1/3 inch oil. (To speed things up even more, use 2 skillets simultaneously.) Heat over high heat until shimmering and just shy of smoking, about 350°F (175°C) on an instant-read thermometer.\n8. Serious Eats / Fred Hardy:\n9. Using tongs or your fingers, gently lower cutlets into hot fat, laying them down away from you to prevent hot fat from splashing toward you. (Work in batches if necessary.) Fry, gently swirling pan and rotating cutlets for even browning, and adjusting heat as necessary for a steady, vigorous bubble (around 300 to 325°F; 150 to 160°C), until bottom side is set, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip cutlets and fry until other side is set, about 1 1/2 minutes longer. Continue cooking, swirling frequently and flipping occasionally, until well browned on both sides, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to paper towels to drain and season with salt right away. Repeat with remaining cutlets.\n10. Slice tonkatsu into thin strips and serve immediately with shredded cabbage, lemon wedges, white rice, Japanese pickles (if desired), and tonkatsu sauce.",
    "notes": "If you can’t find Japanese milk bread, you can substitute it with thick slices of white bread or pain de mie."

    "notes": "Homemade dashi is nice, but not necessary for this simple dish, which has so many other strong flavors. Look for thinly shaved beef at Japanese markets, ask your butcher to shave it for you, or use frozen shaved steak intended for Philly cheesesteaks. The beef can be cooked directly from the freezer if using frozen; just add a few minutes to the cooking time, and make sure to carefully stir the beef and break it apart as it thaws. Beni-shoga is bright red pickled hot ginger. Togarashi is Japanese chile powder, which comes in both ichimi (chiles only) and shichimi (chiles blended with other dried aromatics) versions. Either will work on this dish. All of these ingredients can be found in any Japanese market or well-stocked Western supermarket."

Using a dough hook on low speed, slowly drizzle water mixture into flour mixture and mix, scraping down bowl as needed, until cohesive dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, waiting until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next tablespoon, until all butter is fully incorporated, about 3 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead for 8 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but still sticks to the bottom.\n4. Serious Eats / Estudio Como:\n5. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand to form a smooth round ball, about 1 minute. In a lightly greased large bowl, place the dough seam side down, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a large plate, and let rise at room temperature, 68 to 74℉ (20 to 23 ℃), until the dough is doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\n6. Serious Eats / Estudio Como:\n7. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Press down on dough to deflate and transfer the dough to a clean work surface. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, divide dough in 6 equal pieces (about 145g each). Shape each piece into a smooth ball and set aside on the counter. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel.\n8. Serious Eats / Estudio Como:\n9. Working with one dough ball at a time, use your hands to flatten ball into a 5- x 4-inch rectangle. Fold the upper third of the dough toward the center. Fold the lower third of the dough to the center, mimicking an envelope fold, and lightly pinch the edges of both folded pieces together and press gently to seal the center seam where the folds meet. Then press the new seam into the bun, so it almost disappears.\n10. Serious Eats / Estudio Como:\n11. Roll the bun over, seamside down, and using the palms of your hands, gently roll the bun into a 7 ½ inch log.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375℉(190℃). Transfer 4 buns to one prepared baking sheet seam-side down, and 2 to the other sheet; Set the puns side by side in pairs with 1 inch of space between each bun in the pair. Using a pastry brush, brush buns lightly with vegetable oil and cover loosely with a kitchen towel or greased plastic wrap and proof at room temperature until puffed, and are 9-inches in length, and dough springs back minimally when poked gently with your knuckle, 30 to 45 minutes.\n14.

    "directions": "1. One: Marinate The Chicken Overnight:\n2. Put the chicken breasts in a large ziplock bag with the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons salt. Remove any excess air from the bag and seal tightly. Gently massage the chicken through the bag for a minute or two. Then place the bag in a large dish or bowl and put it in the fridge to marinate overnight or for at least 10 hours. If you'd like, you can rotate the bag once or twice while marinating to ensure adequate coverage of the chicken.\n3. Two: Rest Chicken At Room Temperature:\n4. Approximately 30-45 minutes before you plan to roast the chicken, remove the bag from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature to take the chill off the meat. Keep the bag sealed with the chicken still in the marinade.\n5. Three: Prepare The Pistachio Pesto:\n6. Meanwhile, put the pistachios meats, garlic, lemon zest (reserve the lemon halves or wedges), olive oil, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a mini food processor or blender. Whir until finely chopped and the mixture resembles coarse pesto (scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed). Lastly, add the thyme leaves and pulse a bit more to incorporate.\n7. Four: Apply The Pesto & Bake:\n8. Once the chicken breasts and marinade have rested at room temperature for 30-45 minutes, discard the marinade and pat the chicken breasts dry with a few sheets of paper towel. Arrange the chicken breasts close together (but not overlapping) in a thick-sided, oven-proof skillet or high-sided baking dish. Smear generous amounts of the pistachio pesto underneath the skin of each breast and on the bottom where meat is exposed. Use any excess pesto to coat the top of the skins. Arrange the lemon halves or wedges around the chicken breasts. Position the skillet or baking dish in the center (middle rack) of a pre-heated 375° for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, rotate the pan a half-turn and continue baking for another 20-25 minutes or until the juices of the chicken run clear. Remove the skillet or baking dish from the oven, fully tent it with aluminum foil, and let the chicken rest and re-absorb some of its juices for 8-10 minutes.\n9. Five: Finish & Serve:\n10. Arrange the chicken breasts on a platter or individual plates and squeeze some of the warm, roasted lemon over the chicken. Serve any remaining lemon wedges on the side.",

    "directions": "1. 1. Grind up some ginger, garlic, rock salt & chilli.\n2. 2.

Some people like to slash their chicken, but I prefer to prick it all over with a fork – this helps the marinade to really get deep inside the chicken\n5. 5. Squeeze some lemon juice to start the marinading process – this tenderises the chicken and makes it much easier for the marinade to permeate the meat\n6. 6. Add in the paste made earlier and some coriander powder and paprika\n7. 7. Add in a couple of tablespoons of fresh yoghurt and mix the whole lot together. Leave to marinade for at least 6 hours (I made this batch before going to work – means it’s ready for dinner)\n8. 8. Some recipes call for the marinade to have some red food colouring. DON’T! Chuck it away!\n9. 9. Time to cook our chicken. If, like me, you don’t have a tandoor oven, then BBQ is your next best option.\n10. 10. While chicken is cooking, drink beer. Some people feel this is optional, it is not.\n11. 11. Mmmmm, Chicken! If you stopped here, you’ve got a great starter dish – really tender and full of flavour. But, to make Murgh Makhani, you need to make a sauce to put the chicken in.\n12. For the sauce:\n13. 12. Fry onions, garlic, cardamon, garam masala and chilli powder in the butter\n14. Add in the tomatoes and a little water\n15. Reduce the mixture down and leave to cool a little.\n16. 13. Pour the mixture into a blender and blend to a smooth paste.

Drain and rinse soaked beans.\n2. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n3. Add dried chiles to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with an intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles, place in a small bowl, and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until chiles are pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total. Reduce the heat to medium; add the cumin, coriander, cloves, and star anise to the Dutch oven and stir, toasting until the spices become fragrant. Remove spices, cool slightly, then transfer to a spice grinder and grind into a powder. Set aside.\n4. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n5. Season short ribs on all sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add oil to Dutch oven and heat over high heat until smoking. Add half of short ribs and brown well on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in 3 batches, depending on size of Dutch oven—do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet or plate. Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them in the fat remaining in Dutch oven. Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer all rendered fat into a small bowl and reserve separately. Allow short ribs to cool at room temperature.\n6. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n7. Meanwhile, return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and add 1 cup (240ml) chicken broth, using a flat wooden spoon or stiff spatula to scrape browned bits off of bottom of pan. Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer, add toasted chiles to liquid, and cook until chiles have softened and liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to a blender. Add ground spices, chocolate, tomato paste, coffee, anchovies, soy sauce, and Marmite. Blend at high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until a completely smooth purée has formed, about 2 minutes. Set chile purée aside.\n8. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n9. Trim meat from short rib bones and hand-chop into rough 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch pieces (finer or larger, as you prefer), reserving bones separately. Add any accumulated meat juices to chile purée.\n10. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n11. Heat 4 tablespoons (60ml) rendered beef fat (if necessary, add vegetable oil to reach 4 tablespoons) in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic, fresh chiles, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chile purée and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot, until chile mixture begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Add remaining chicken stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to lowest possible setting, add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender, about 1 hour. Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is okay).\n12. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n13. Using tongs, remove and discard bay leaves and bones. (At this point, any excess meat still attached to the bones can be removed, chopped, and added back to the chili, if desired.) Add vodka (or bourbon), brown sugar, and hot sauce and stir to combine. Season to taste with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and additional vinegar.\n14. Serious Eats / Qi Ai:\n15. Serve immediately, or, for best flavor, allow to cool and refrigerate overnight, or up to 1 week in a sealed container. Reheat and serve with desired garnishes.",

(If you're using pre-cooked tortillas, warm them up in a skillet or the microwave before rolling the burrito to make them more flexible)\n10. ½ medium-sized white onion, 1 ½ cups shredded Oaxaca or low moisture mozzarella cheese, 4 8\" diameter flour tortillas\n11. Place the burritos seem-side-down in a preheated sandwich press and cook, until slightly golden on the outside, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, use a skillet set over medium heat, turning as needed. Serve immediately, with your favorite salsa for dipping (I use avocado salsa).",
    "notes": "Begin with 12 oz of cooked, prepared chicken from the Marinated Chicken for Tacos or Chicken Al Pastor recipe. I make this chicken in bulk, freeze the cooked chicken in 12 oz portions, and defrost to use in this recipe for a quick meal. Uncooked tortillas are one of my favorite new products. They come in the refrigerated section at the grocery store, and can be prepared in just a few minutes. They make super high quality fresh tortillas that take these burritos to the next level! If you want to make this easier, just pick up a standard 8 oz bag of microwave cilantro lime rice! After microwaving, divide the rice into 4 portions for the burritos, it will be a little less than ½ cup per burrito."

    "directions": "1. Add the salt to the flour in a large mixing bowl.\n2. Rub the two types of fat lightly into flour until it resembles breadcrumbs.\n3.

Bake at 165 degrees C (fan oven) for about 50 – 55 minutes until golden.",
    "notes": "Top tips: Beef skirt is the cut traditionally used for Cornish pasties. This is the underside of the belly of the animal. It has no gristle and little fat, cooks in the same amount of time as the raw vegetables and its juice produces wonderful gravy. Use a firm waxy potato such as Maris Peer or Wilja. A floury potato will disintegrate on cooking. Cornish pasties freeze well. It’s best to freeze them after glazing but before baking. They can be baked from frozen, just reduce the oven temperature a little and add an extra few minutes to the baking time. Be sure to check that your pasties are piping hot all the way through before eating, whether you’re baking them from scratch, from frozen or reheating them."

Meanwhile, strain the broth in which the chicken was cooked and discard the cilantro, garlic, and onion.\n6. Return the broth and chicken back into the large pot and add the white hominy.\n7. Green Sauce:\n8. To make the green sauce first, lightly toast the pumpkin seeds in a hot skillet until they start “dancing” (popping), making sure not to burn them. Remove them from the skillet and let them cool.\n9. Then, add all of the sauce ingredients (except the oil) to a blender with about ½ cup of the chicken broth and blend until smooth.\n10. In a large skillet, heat the oil, add the sauce, and cook until it changes to a darker color, about 7 minutes. Season with salt, then reduce the temperature and continue cooking for about 1 more minute, stirring frequently.\n11. Making the pozole verde:\n12. Place the stockpot with the chicken, broth, and hominy over medium-high heat. When the soup reaches boiling point, pour the green sauce into the pot, and reduce the heat, and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes.\n13. Taste the pozole to see if it needs extra seasoning. If necessary, add chicken broth to increase the flavor.\n14. Serve the green pozole in large bowls and place the garnishes in serving dishes for everyone to add to their bowls.\n15. Enjoy!",
    "notes": "For the sauce, you can also roast the tomatillos, garlic, and onion. Check the post for poblano peppers to learn how to roast them. Canned hominy can be easily found in Latin or Mexican stores. If using dried hominy, soak it overnight and cook until tender. Bone-in chicken thighs add more flavor to the broth, but you can also use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. When blending the verde sauce, ensure a smooth consistency. Strain the sauce for an even finer texture if desired. Customize the heat level by adding or reducing the number of jalapeños or adding a serrano pepper for extra heat. Traditional garnishes include shredded lettuce, radishes, lime wedges, avocado slices, and corn tostadas. However, you can always add your favorite topping."

Then, pour the sauce slowly through a fine sieve for a nice homogenous texture.\n5. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Place the sauce and steaks in a large bowl, marinate the meat.\n6. Marinade for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n7. Cooking on a frying pan\n8. Now, this is the easiest since almost anyone has a frying pan or skillet at home. Once your meat has marinated, cut it into small fine strips. Make sure to remove any excess adobo sauce.\n9. Warm the frying pan and add 1 – 2 Tablespoons of oil until hot enough that it sizzles when you place the meat. Add onion and pineapple slices along with the meat to cook.\n10. Make sure to turn the meat as needed to avoid the meat sticking to the pan.\n11. Cooking in a Vertical Rotisserie:\n12. To cook in the Vertical Rotisserie, stack the meat intercalated with slices of onions and pineapple. Let any marinade drain for 20 minutes before starting the timer. 1 Hr. is enough to cook 2 pounds. Cooking will vary depending on your Rotiserrie equipment,\n13. After the meat is cooked, shave or slice it with a sharp knife and place it in an already-warm skillet to give it that crisper taste as they do at the taquerias in Mexico.\n14. Cooking in your broiler:\n15. This option to make your tacos al pastor at home is using the broiler in your oven. Cut the meat as for Kabobs and insert into the skewer placing onion and pineapple slices between the meat.\n16. This method will take about 20 minutes to cook, rotating at least twice while cooking.\n17. You can also use your gas or charcoal grill to cook the marinated pork steaks.\n18. Slice the meat finely and make your tacos with warm tortillas, topped with chopped onion and cilantro, onion, pineapple and a salsa of your choice.",
    "notes": "Marinate the pork for at least 4 hours, or a little longer, like overnight, to ensure the flavors penetrate deeply. I just mentioned how marinating the meat produces juicy and tender meat. However, don't marinate for more than 24 hours. The acidity of the mixture can break down the meat too much. Grill pineapple slices or place them on top of the meat stack to add moisture and caramelized sweetness. After the meat is done cooking, thinly slice it off the stack, ensuring a mix of slightly charred and tender pieces."

    "directions": "1. First, I recommend peeling the potatoes and boiling them until well cooked. While the potatoes are cooking, you can start your prep work to have everything in hand when the tacos are ready.\n2. Start by cutting the cilantro, lettuce and have everything set to build your taco. I recommend picking the red onions one night before so they can be ready the next day. I will provide that recipe with this delicious taco recipe. There are many ways to compliment your tacos, for example, you can cook some red rice or refried beans. Many people like to add avocado on top with plenty of homemade salsa.\n3. Cook the chorizo with a spoonful of olive oil, when ready add the potatoes and mash them together. You are going to make a chorizo mash, adding a pinch of salt, garlic powder, and oregano. It is very important to season your taco filling for a bold flavor, many people won’t season it thinking the chorizo will give the entire flavor. You will notice the difference when seasoned with the oregano. It provides aroma, besides just being salty with just plain salt.\n4. Fill your tortillas and close them with a toothpick, so your filling won’t come out while frying or your taco may open.\n5. When set fry the oil in a pan large enough to fit at least 4 of the tacos. It is better to cook little by little than a much bigger batch so your tacos will fry well. Let the oil be very hot, when you put your taco in because if it is not hot enough your tacos won’t come out, as they should. Their consistency will be chewy and we want them “bien dorados”. Let them sit for a minute for the excess oil to dry. After that, you can enjoy your tacos with everything on top. Enjoy!",

Cook on low, medium heat to let the flavors meld without overcooking the vegetables. Garnish with fresh cilantro, a squeeze of lime, or sliced avocado. Serve with warm corn tortillas or crusty bread for a comforting meal. Swap ground beef for ground turkey, chicken, or plant-based meat alternatives. Add diced jalapeños or chipotle peppers for a spicy kick. Use vegetable broth for a vegetarian version. Replace with beef broth for a more robust flavor. Use dried mint or parsley if fresh herbs aren’t available. Some cooks in Mexico use granulated chicken bouillon instead of chicken broth. Follow the package directions to make the 4 cups of broth needed. You can also add extra broth for a more liquid soup. You can add other diced vegetables like carrots, potatoes, zucchini, chayote, cabbage, and potatoes to the broth while it is simmering. If adding carrots, add them at the beginning with the tomato sauce. Other vegetables will take less time to cook and can be added when you add the meatballs. I prefer to buy ground meat with a little bit of fat, like the one sold at the market with an 85/15% fat content. It has more flavor, and you can easily remove the fat after it floats to the surface of the broth. If you want to make your Mexican Meatballs spicy, add serrano or jalapeño peppers to the tomato salsa while you are making it in the blender."

    "ingredients": "## For the chicken:\nFor the chicken:\n1 Large chicken cut up in pieces\nAbout 8 cups of water\n1 Small onion cut up in pieces\n3 Garlic cloves\nSalt to taste\n## For the Sauce:\nFor the Sauce:\n6 Mulato peppers\n4 Ancho peppers\n6 Pasilla peppers\n1 Tablespoon of reserved pepper seeds\n6 Whole cloves\n½ Teaspoon black peppercorn\n¼ Teaspoon coriander seeds\n¼ Teaspoonanises seeds\n¾ Cup sesame seeds\n¾ Inch of mexican cinnamon stick\n½ Cup of raisins\n⅓ Cup unskinned almonds\n⅓ Cup peanuts\n1 Corn tortilla\n3 Small slices of french bread\n⅓ Cup of raw pumpkin seeds\n½ Small white onion sliced\n2 Medium roasted tomatoes\n3 Garlic gloves roasted\n½ Large ripe dark-skinned plantain peeled, thickly sliced\n1 Tablet of Mexican drinking Chocolate* About 3.1 ounces.\nThe reserved broth from the cooked chicken.\n## ½ Cup of oil or lard to fry the ingredients\n½ Cup of oil or lard to fry the ingredients\nSalt to taste",
    "directions": "1. Combine all ingredients in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is just cooked through, skimming foam, about 35 minutes. Transfer chicken to bowl; cover and chill. Strain and reserve broth in pot.\n2. For the Mole Sauce\n3. Get all the ingredients ready according to the list. This step is very important.\n4. Prepare the peppers . Make sure to clean the dry peppers with a wet cloth and cut the peppers using your kitchen scissors if possible to flatten them for an even toasting.\n5. Have a large pot ready with simmering chicken broth or water to soak all the ingredients after toasting or frying. They will get softer and easier to grind this way.\n6. In a skillet toast the dry peppers a few at a time, on both sides, pressing them down as you turn them, until the inside flesh turns tobacco brown. This takes a few seconds, take care not to let them burn. Place the peppers and the chocolate in the bowl with the broth to soak. Keep toasting the rest of the peppers and placing them in the broth.\n7. Meanwhile, toast separately the reserved peppers seeds, the coriander seeds, the anise seeds and sesame seeds. Set them aside to cool.\n8. Grind in an electric coffee/spice grinder as finely as possible. Cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, and all the toasted ingredients except the sesame seeds. In case you do not have a grinder, but you have a professional blender skip this step and place the spices and seeds on the pot with the rest of the ingredients to be grinded in the blender.\n9. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds for serving the mole; grind the rest as finely as possible. After this step add this mixture of spices and seeds to the bowl with the peppers.\n10. Now, add a small portion of the lard or vegetable oil to a skillet and begin frying the following ingredients separately draining any excess fat after frying: the raisins until plump up, the almonds until well browned, the pumpkin seeds until they swell (take care, since they tend to explode and jump).\n11. Every ingredient will be added to the pot with the chicken broth. You can roast the tomatoes and garlic cloves while frying the rest of the ingredients. Fry the onions until golden brown and place in the bowl.\n12. Fry the tortilla and bread until crisp. Only add a little more lard at a time or it will be absorbed, specially by the tortilla and bread.\n13. Add plantain and sauté until golden, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, drain excess fat and transfer to bowl. Make sure to use a ripe plantain.\n14. This is the bowl where all the fried and toasted ingredients were placed and now are ready to go into the blender. It is going to look a little bit messy. Crush the bread and tortilla roughly, chop the tomatoes roasted tomatoes. This will make the grinding process a little bit easier.\n15. Put ½ cup of the chicken broth into the blender jar, don’t forget to add peeled garlic. Gradually add the spice mixture and blend well; then add another ½ cup of broth and gradually blend the fried ingredients to a slightly fine paste. Try not to add more liquid (unless your blender motor is heating or smoking) but constantly release the blades with a rubber spatula. You will have to do this step in 2 or 3 batches until everything has been pureed. I use my Vitamix and grind the whole sauce twice. If the end results are still coarse, pass the whole mixture through a strainer.\n16. In a large skillet over medium heat, reheat the sauce, scraping the bottom of the pan very often to avoid sticking. Season with salt.\n17. Continue frying until the mixture is very thick, about 8 minutes, and stir. Add more broth as needed to desire thickness and continue cooking, the mixture should be bubbling and splattering—for about 25 minutes. By now pools of oil should be forming on the surface.\n18. Add cooked chicken to hot mole; simmer until chicken is heated through, about 10 minutes. To serve, place a piece of chicken on a warm plate. Spoon on plenty of the mole sauce; sprinkle with sesame seeds. In Mexico it is usually serve with white rice with peas and a lot of warm tortillas.\n19. This mole can be made well ahead and the leftover sauce can be kept very successfully in the freezer for about six months. When reheated it will probably have to be diluted with more broth and freshly cooked chicken, or better yet used for chicken-filled enchiladas.",
    "notes": "This Mole Sauce is not spicy if you want to add some heat to the sauce, add 2 dried chipotle peppers or morita peppers. If you want it a little sweeter, add more chocolate. some recipes suggest frying the dry peppers, you could choose to do so."

    "notes": "Oat flour is an alternative to oats; just reduce the amount to 6 teaspoons. The atole de Avena should be thick and creamy, but you can adjust the thickness by adding more or less liquid, depending on your preference. The sweetness can vary depending on personal preference. You can use 1 oz piloncillo (Mexican raw sugar) for a more authentic flavor, but regular sugar or honey works well. Blending the oats before cooking helps create a smooth, uniform texture, but if you prefer a rustic or chunkier texture, you can skip the blending and cook the oats whole. For this step, you can use your blender or small food processor. Simmer the atole over low heat and stir frequently to avoid burning the bottom. The mixture can thicken quickly, especially with oats, so be mindful of the heat level. For a dairy-free version, use plant-based milk like almond, oat, coconut, or soy milk instead of cow’s milk. Coconut and almond milk will add a subtle sweetness, so adjust the sugar in the recipe."

    "directions": "1. Cut the corn tortillas into small squares, about 1½ in. wide. You can use a knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut them.\n2. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Once it is hot, place the tortilla pieces in the oil and fry them until they are golden brown. Make sure to use a frying pan that is large enough, in order to not overcrowd the pan. Stir and turn the tortilla pieces as needed until they acquire a golden-brown color. This step will take about 6 minutes.\n3. Return the frying pan to the stove and place it over medium heat. Add the chopped white onion and lightly fry it for a few seconds, then stir in the chopped serrano pepper. Keep cooking for about 2 minutes.\n4. Add the chopped tomato and cook for about 3 more minutes, then add the eggs. Let the eggs start to cook without stirring them yet.\n5. Once the egg whites start to look cooked around the edges, gently stir the eggs. Once you see the egg yolks start to cook, stir in the tortilla chips, season with salt, and gently mix them together with the eggs. When the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove the frying pan from the heat. The tortillas should still be crispy by the time you serve your migas. Do not wait until the eggs are cooked to add the tortilla chips. Remember that the eggs will keep cooking even after you remove the frying pan from the heat.\n6. WHAT TO SERVE WITH MIGAS\n7. Migas, as many Mexican Breakfasts, are traditionally served with refried beans or plain cooked beans topped with some crumbled Queso Fresco, and some avocado slices on the side. Some people also place a spicy salsa on the table for those that want to add more heat to their Migas.",
    "notes": "For this recipe, you can leave the already cut-out tortilla pieces on a baking sheet covered with a kitchen napkin on your counter. That way the tortillas will be dry and will absorb less oil at cooking time. They will also take less time to get crispy. You can use another type of tomatoes. If you have any leftover Migas, store them in the fridge for up to two days inside an airtight container. Reheat in a frying pan at medium heat for about 6-8 minutes. The only downside for leftover Migas is that the tortillas will become soft."

Depending on how you like the consistency, a little more milk will be needed in the final cooking stage. The sweetness of the condensed milk will be enough for some, but if you have a very sweet tooth, go ahead and drizzle in some more. If the cinnamon flavor is too much for you, try other flavorings: a teaspoon of vanilla, a pinch of ground nutmeg, lemon, or orange rind, or even the leaves of orange trees, which are all good additions. Lastly, if you want sweet condensed milk, check the Baking aisle or the Mexican aisle for different brands and prices."

    "directions": "1. For the filling:\n2. Place the clean peppers in a medium size saucepan along with 3 cups of water. Turn the heat to medium high. Once the water comes to a boil, turn the heat off and let the peppers soak in that water for 15 minutes. This will allow the peppers to soften. In case they still don’t look soft after the 15 minutes, leave them in for another 5 minutes.\n3. While the peppers are soaking, season the ground beef with salt and pepper and mix well. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet at medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meat and fry it at medium heat. Cook the meat for about 5 minutes, then stir in the chopped onion and minced garlic. Keep cooking for 1 more minute.\n4. Add the diced carrots to the skillet and cook for 4 minutes. After that time, stir in the potatoes and keep cooking for about 8 more minutes\n5. At this time, remove the peppers from the soaking water and place them in your blender with ½ cup of the soaking water or clean water. Process the peppers and water until you have a smooth sauce.\n6. Using a strainer, pour the sauce into the skillet. The strainer will catch the leftover bits and pieces from the pepper skins. Stir and check the sauce for seasoning, and add salt if needed. Keep cooking for about 5 more minutes, until the vegetables are cooked. Make sure you do not overcook the vegetables, since they will keep cooking when you steam the tamales. Make sure that the potatoes still have some shape to them, otherwise they will disintegrate when you cook the tamales.\n7. For the cornhusks:\n8. Take the husks out from their package, separate them, and remove any corn silk that they might have on them. Inspect the husks and discard any that are damaged or have holes in them.\n9. Place the husks in a warm bath of hot or warm water to soak for 30 minutes. You can do this in a large pot, a large bowl, or in your kitchen sink. This step will help to soften the husks so that they are pliable when you’re assembling the tamales.\n10. For the dough:\n11. In a large bowl, beat the lard until it changes to a lighter color. You can do this step with your mixer or by hand.\n12. Slowly add the corn masa harina, and then add the chicken broth. Mix well, taste, and season with salt. Beat until all the ingredients are well combined and the dough is light and spongy.\n13. Assembling the tamales:\n14. Remove the husks from their warm water, then shake them dry or dry them with a kitchen towel. You want to remove any excess water they might have.\n15. Place one cornhusk on your work surface, with the wide end facing towards you. Spread about 2-3 tablespoons of dough in the center, but closer to the bottom of the cornhusk. Use a spoon or plastic spatula to spread the dough out evenly.\n16. Top with 2 tablespoons of the ground beef filling in the center of the dough. Fold one side of the husk towards the center, then fold the other side towards the center, too. Finally, fold the narrow end towards the center. Repeat this process with remaining husks, dough, and filling.\n17. Cooking the tamales:\n18. Place the tamales on a tray while you’re finishing up with the rest of the assembly process.\n19. To get your pot ready for steaming, add 3 cups of hot water into the pot and place the steamer rack inside.\n20. Place a layer of cornhusks on the steamer rack, then place the tamales on top of that in a standing position. Next, cover the tamales with another layer of the cornhusks and a dish towel. Finally, place the lid on the pot.\n21. Steam the tamales over medium heat for about 60 minutes, or until the corn husk easily separates from the dough (you’ll have to pull a tamale out of the pot to test this). During the steaming time, check the steamer to see if it needs more water (be careful when removing the lid). When the tamales are done, wait for 10 minutes so that the dough can firm up. Serve the tamales while still hot.",

    "directions": "1. Make the Tomato Sauce\n2. First, place tomatoes, onion, and garlic cloves in a large stockpot or saucepan. Cover with water, put the saucepan lid on, and cook over high heat until it starts boiling; then reduce heat to simmer. Cook until tomatoes are soft and skins are peeling.\n3. Then, carefully, place only the tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a blender and puree until you have a smooth sauce. (Add a few tablespoons of water to the blender, only if your blender is having a hard time processing the sauce)\n4. Lastly, if you want your sauce to be smooth, use a strainer to sieve the sauce.\n5. Roast and Peel the Poblano Peppers:\n6. You can roast them over an open flame on a gas stove, under a broiler, or in your oven.\n7. Roasting on an open fire:\n8. First, on your gas stove, turn the heat to medium-high, place the peppers, and roast for about 1-2 minutes per side, rotating the peppers to obtain a uniform roasting.\n9. Then, place them in a damp cloth and cover them (this way, they retain more flavor). However, you can also place them inside a plastic bag.\n10. Once it has cooled down enough to handle, peel the skin off the peppers with your fingers or gently scrapping the skins with a spoon.\n11. After peeling the peppers, make a slit cut lengthwise in each one. Remove seeds and veins.\n12. Soak them in water with vinegar and salt. (This step is optional, but it gives the peppers a great flavor.)\n13. After 15 minutes, dry them with paper towels.\n14. Roasting pepper on your broiler:\n15. Set your oven to broil.\n16. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and place the peppers on the baking sheet.\n17. Broil them until you can see the skin blister and they are evenly roasted.\n18. Remove them and cover them with a layer of aluminum foil for about 10 minutes.\n19. Once they have cooled down enough to handle, peel the skin off of the peppers with your fingers.\n20. After peeling the peppers, make a slit cut lengthwise in each one. Remove seed and veins.\n21. Roasting in your Oven:\n22. Set your oven temperature to 400º and place your peppers over a tray and into your oven for about 20 minutes.\n23. After they are charred, remove them from the oven and place them in a plastic or paper bag. Let the peppers steam for about 10 minutes. This step will make it easier to peel off the skin.\n24. Peel off the charred skin, make a vertical slit down one side of each pepper, and remove the seeds while keeping the stem intact.\n25. Stuff the Peppers:\n26. Gently stuff each poblano pepper with the cheese, ensuring not to overfill. Close the slit and use toothpicks to secure the edges if needed.\n27. Coat and Fry the Stuffed Peppers:\n28. Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot enough to fry but not smoking.\n29. While the oil is heating, beat the egg whites with the help of an electric mixer in a bowl until stiff peaks form.\n30. Then, gently add the egg yolks to the egg whites one by one, using a wooden spoon, until you have a fluffy mixture. Season with salt.\n31. Now, on a plate with flour, carefully coat each poblano pepper in the flour. Shake off any excess flour. Make sure the chiles rellenos do not open while doing this step.\n32. Then, dip the peppers in the beaten egg mixture completely.\n33. Carefully place each stuffed pepper in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides. This should take about 3-5 minutes per side.\n34. Drain and Serve:\n35. Place the fried chiles rellenos on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.\n36. Serve the chiles rellenos on a plate, over and drizzled with tomato sauce or salsa.\n37. Remember to remove the toothpicks before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade Chiles Rellenos!",
    "notes": "When looking for peppers, look for the ones with smooth and shiny skin to know they are fresh. Also, look for medium to small sizes; they are easier to handle and have more flavor. After roasting your peppers, carefully peel the skin to preserve the pepper's shape. If you are looking for other ideas for stuffing, look into the Chile relleno de picadillo , Chiles en Nogada , with different stuffing options. After stuffing the peppers, you can use toothpicks to secure the slit edges; just remember to remove them before serving. For the batter, make sure the egg whites form stiff peaks form and gently fold in the egg yolks to create a light and fluffy batter. This results in a crisp coating for the peppers."

    "directions": "1. Heat a griddle and roast the tomatoes, garlic cloves and onion. Roast until tomatoes are blistered and slightly softened. Rotate often for an even roasting. Garlic cloves will roast faster. Remove them after a few minutes.\n2. Once the vegetables are roasted, peel the tomatoes place them into a blender with the onion and garlic, puree until you have a smooth sauce. Add some chicken broth if needed.\n3. In a large pot, heat the 1 Tbsp. of vegetable oil over medium high heat. Add the tomato sauce mix and cook for about 3 minutes, it will start boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. The color of the sauce will reduce and change color.\n4. While the sauce is cooking, start cutting the tortillas into thin strips in case you haven’t already done that.\n5. After the 5 minutes of simmering the sauce, add the chicken broth and turn the heat up. When it starts to boil, lower the heat to simmer for about 10-12 more minutes.\n6. Add the Epazote branch and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 3 more minutes.\n7. Now, in a large skillet heat the oil and start frying the tortillas (making sure not to over crowd the skillet) until they are crispy and have a golden color. You will need to work in batches in this step. Place the fried tortillas over a plate covered with paper napkins to drain any excess oil.\n8. In the remaining oil, fry the pasilla pepper strips, these will get crisp very quickly. Once they get crispy, remove and set aside.\n9. Gather all your garnishes: cut the lime in wedges and the avocado in cubes, ready to assemble the bowls of soup.\n10. Ladle the soup into bowls add the tortilla strips and then the rest of the garnishes. You can also place the garnishes at the table and let everyone serve themselves.",
    "notes": "*You can also add one pasilla pepper to the sauce, soak one pepper in water and onece soften add to the tomatoes while making the sauce. The pasilla peppers have shiny dark brown and wrinkled skin. The color resembles that of a prune’s skin. It is a very mild pepper used to make the famous Salsa Borracha (Drunken Sauce), as a garnish for the tortilla soup, and in moles and stews. Some recipes also include the seeds and the veins in order to give more flavor and spiciness to the dish. ** Day old tortillas are better for frying since they are dryer and absorb less oil and tend to crisp faster. Just leave them on your kitchen counter overnight, cover with a kitchen napkin or place in your oven at 250 for 10-12 minutes before frying. Or you could bake the tortilla strips instead of frying. *** Some cooks prefer not to roast the tomato, onion, and garlic. These ingredients are just chopped and puree in the blender and skipping the roasting step. That is a personal choice. OPTIONAL GARNISHES: · 1 ½ cup of shredded cooked chicken & 1 roasted Poblano Pepper, cut into strips. · Chopped onion and cilantro to taste."

Makes the burrito filling juicy and holds it all together, rather than dry and crumbly (which too many burritos are!) Substitution: Saute 1 garlic clove minced in a little oil until golden. Add 1 can pinto, red kidney or black beans with 1/4 cup of the liquid in the can, 1/2 tsp each cumin, onion and paprika powder. Stir few minutes until beans thoroughly heated then mash or puree. Any beans will actually work just fine, just a different colour! Rice - you'll need 1 cup of uncooked rice to make 2.5 cups cooked rice. See here for instructions for how to cook plain rice, or make Mexican Red Rice! Storage - Wrap in cling wrap or foil, fridge for 4 days or freeze. Best to warm in oven - 15 minutes at 180C/350F wrapped in foil. Frozen - thaw overnight then warm in oven 15 minutes.

Set one palm on top of one breast to hold it still then use a chef’s knife with the other hand to slice the breast in half horizontally.

    "directions": "1. Before you start cooking, soak the bamboo skewers in water to cover for 30 minutes.\n2. Marinate the chicken: Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, grind the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and peppercorns to a fine powder. Transfer to a large bowl (if using a large enough mortar, you can use that), add the tamarind paste, brown sugar, turmeric, salt, cinnamon and ½ cup coconut milk. Whisk to thoroughly combine.\n3. Slice the chicken against the grain on the diagonal into ½-inch-thick strips. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, mix well to coat and marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes, or cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. (The longer the chicken marinates, the better. As the chicken marinates, turn it in the marinade a couple of times.)\n4. While the chicken marinates, prepare the peanut sauce: Place the peanuts in the bowl of a food processor, or use a mortar and pestle, and grind the peanuts until finely ground but with texture. (Take care not to grind into peanut butter!) Set aside.\n5. Add ⅓ cup of the coconut milk to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the red curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and the oil separates, about 5 minutes. (Depending on the fat content of the coconut milk, the oil might not separate and that’s OK.)\n6. Add the remaining coconut milk, the peanuts, tamarind paste and palm sugar. Adjust heat to medium-low and gently simmer, stirring frequently and making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom or slides of the pot, until thickened to the consistency of a dip, about 5 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick before 5 minutes, add a splash of water so the flavors have time to fully develop. Taste and add more fish sauce, if desired, and more tamarind paste to brighten. Transfer to a serving bowl and set aside. (The peanut sauce can be covered and refrigerated up to 1 week in advance or stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.)\n7. Prepare the ajaad (if desired): In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar and a small pinch of salt. Cook over medium, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Place the cucumber and chiles (if using) in a small serving bowl and pour in the cooled pickling liquid. Cover until ready to serve. (The vinegar mixture and cucumber should not be combined more than 30 minutes in advance, so the cucumber stays fresh and crisp.)\n8. Cook the chicken: Thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers. If grilling, heat a grill on high (skip to the next step if cooking on the stovetop). Shake off any excess marinade and place the chicken skewers perpendicular to the grates, for grill marks. Discard the marinade. Cook, uncovered, until browned and slightly charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and grill the other side until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes more.\n9. If cooking on the stovetop, heat a large pan (preferably non-stick or cast-iron) or grill pan over medium-high. Add enough oil to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, after about 90 seconds, cook until browned on each side and cooked though, 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Do not crowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.)\n10. Serve chicken skewers with ajaad, and peanut sauce for dipping.",
    "notes": "For the best results, use coconut milk with the highest fat content (ideally 15 grams per can). One 14-ounce can of coconut milk will be enough for the chicken marinade and the peanut sauce. Thai tamarind paste is not the same as Indian or Mexican tamarind pastes. Use Thai tamarind paste (sometimes labeled concentrate), available at Asian markets and online, for this recipe."

Turn the chicken to coat, seal the bag, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours, turning occasionally to redistribute the marinade (see Note).\n2. Serious Eats / Diana Chistruga:\n3. Remove the chicken from the bag and pat it dry with paper towels. Season with kosher salt and pepper, going heavy on the pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat until it is lightly smoking. Add the chicken pieces and cook without disturbing until they are lightly browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip the chicken.

Transfer to a medium bowl, add the remaining marinade, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate while you cook the rice and prepare the sauce.\n6. Serious Eats / Diana Chistruga:\n7. For the rice: Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing. Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.\n8. Serious Eats / Diana Chistruga:\n9. For the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Whisk to combine. Season to taste with salt.\n10. Serious Eats / Diana Chistruga:\n11. To serve: Return the entire contents of the chicken bowl (chicken, marinade, and all juices) to the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through. To serve, divide the rice, lettuce, tomato, and toasted pita bread evenly among four to six plates. Pile the chicken on top of the rice. Top with the white sauce and hot sauce. Serve immediately, passing extra sauce at the table.\n12. Serious Eats / Diana Chistruga:\n13. Special Equipment\n14. Blender, 12-inch cast iron skillet or stainless steel skillet",
    "notes": "Do not marinate the chicken longer than 4 hours or it’ll get a mushy texture. If you must delay cooking the chicken for any reason, remove it from the marinade, pat it dry with paper towels, and refrigerate until ready to cook."

    "notes": "You can use 4 store-bought chicken breast cutlets instead of whole chicken breasts, but pounding your own ensures even thickness and more reliable cooking. Both American- and European-style butter will work for this recipe, but we recommend seeking out European-style butter, as its higher fat content produces a more richly flavored sauce."

Place the contents of the saucepan in your blender and process until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside.\n4. FOR THE DOUGH:\n5. Detach the husk from the cobs and place in a large pot with hot water to soften (see notes).\n6. Remove the kernels from the cob with a sharp knife, then place them in your blender or food processor. Process until they’ve been around, but still have some texture. Pour in a large bowl.\n7. Stir in the softened lard (or butter) and mix well. Add the masa-harina little by little as needed. Depending on how watery your dough is, you will need to add or reduce the amount of masa-harina. Mix the dough until it looks like a smooth and thick cake batter.\n8. Season with salt and sugar. The amount of sugar and salt will depend on the corn flavor, and your taste. Sometimes, the corn is too sweet and other times they are just plain in taste. Remember that some of this seasoning gets lost when you are steaming the tamales.\n9. ASSEMBLING THE TAMALES:\n10. Remove the husks from their warm bath and drain well. Place the smallest husks at the bottom of your steamer.\n11. Place two husks together, with the wide sides facing each other and slightly overlapping (if the husks are too small, you can place more than two together). Spread ⅓ cup of the corn masa dough and add 3 – 4 small cubes of the raw pork meat, then top with 3 tablespoons of the sauce. Finally, place an epazote leaf (if using) on top of the salsa.\n12. Fold the sides of the husk to the center and then do the same with the narrow edges of the husks. To tie the tamales, do so in the same way as if you were tying a package.\n13. TO COOK THE TAMALES:\n14. Place the steaming rack in your pot, add 2 cups of hot water, and cover the steaming rack with the small husks. Place the tamales in the pot, arranging them in a vertical position. You can also place them in a horizontal position like I did in the pictures (my pot is too small to hold them vertically). Cover the tamales with extra corn husks and then place the lid on the pot. Cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Check the pot during the cooking time to see if you need to add more hot water.",
    "notes": "One chipotle pepper won’t render a spicy sauce. If you like spicy, you can add two or more peppers. Not everyone can find lard in their area, but butter works very well for these types of tamales. You can also use dried husks (the ones sold in packages) for this recipe, or a combination of both"

When the sauce and chocolate are fully dissolved in the stock, turn heat to medium low.\n3. One by one, submerge the tortillas into the piping-hot mole rojo. Place each tortilla on a plate, open, and spoon 2 to 3 Tbsps shredded chicken into its center.\n4. Over the chicken, sprinkle 1 to 2 Tbps of mozzarella cheese, 1 tsp. of cream, and 1 to 2 Tbsps of the sliced onions.\n5. Fold each tortilla into a thin roll (like a taquito) and garnish with a sprinkling of queso fresco, onion slivers, crema and toasted pepitas.\n6. Serve each person 2 to 3 enchiladas, accompanied by a side of Mexican rice and beans. Enjoy! Especially if you want to get engaged.",
    "notes": "Familia Kitchen doesn’t usually list specific brands in our recipes, but Patricia and her mother’s mole specifically calls for the following three products, available at most grocery stores: Doña Maria Mole sauce, Abuelita chocolate tablets (which have a subtle, almost-bitter, deep flavor—different from U.S. chocolate), and Cacique Crema Mexicana. You can use white sugar in the mole sauce, but Patricia’s mother recommends using café azucar or brown sugar because it is sweeter and richer."
